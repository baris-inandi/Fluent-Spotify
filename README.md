## Fluent-Spotify


OK, the long waited new spotify gui is happening. The web player had the new gui for a while now and we have all seen this coming. The web player gui is on the way to the new spotify desktop app. This means i will be no longer maintaining this project until spotify decides what should be done with the desktop app. If the new gui (thats currently on testing) is released, fluent-spotify probably will no longer work and will need a complete rewrite.

After all this is over, this project will continue. Also i won't use dribbblish if the new gui is released.
